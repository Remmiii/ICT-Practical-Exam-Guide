A guide to help prepare for the practical exam on `23/05/2023`! Goodluck!

# ðŸ“ƒGuide:
1. Make a new file and name it anything you want but always end with an .htm extension. Set the columns to 40% and 60% and the rows on the left section to 40% and 60%. Link the file source as frame1.htm (top left row) and frame2.htm (bottom left row). Close it with `</frameset>`. Link another file source for the other frames (frames 3, 4, 5, 6,& 7). Close with `</frameset>` again and close the whole code with </html>.
2. Make a new file and name it `frame34567.htm`. Set the rows to 50% and 50% and link 2 files: `frame34.htm` and `frame567.htm`. Close with `</frameset>` and `</html>`. 
3. Make a new file and name it `frame34.htm`. Set the columns as 50% and 50%. Then link it with 2 files: `frame3.htm` and `frame4.htm`. Close with `</frameset>` and `</html>`. 
4. Make a new file and name it `frame567.htm`. Set the column into 3 sections (100/3 = 33): 33%, 33% and 33%. Link 3 files: `frame5.htm`, `frame6.htm`, and `frame7.htm`. Close with `</frameset>` and `</html>`. 
5. Make a new file and name it `frame1.htm`. Use `<h1>` tag to make the header as H1 and put the image by using `<img src="image here" width=0 length=0>`. (NOTE THAT YOU NEED TO CHANGE THE WIDTH AND HEIGHT OF THE PICTURE DEPENDING ON THE PICTUREâ€™S RESOLUTION!). And close by using `</html>`.
6. Make a new file and name it `frame3.htm`. To add a video, use `<video>` tag and add your own width and height. Assign the source of the video and set the video type as your video extension (in this case, it is mp4). Close using `</video>` and `</html>`. 
7. Make a new file and name it `frame4`. Add a header using `<h1>` tag and a paragraph using `<p>` tag. Add bullet points using `<li>` tag and make hyperlinks using `<a href>` so the user can navigate through the different sections. 
8. The other frames are for you to practice on (frame 5, 6 and 7). Goodluck for the exam.
